# Transitioning into Retirement

The TLDR: it may actually be psychological and economically optimal to be *forced* into retirement. 

### Why?

I go crazy and depressed if I have nothing to do. I had a half-year stint once without work, and even though I was prepared, even though I had a big, fat stash to use, the sheer aimlessness of it exacted quite a mental toll. 

Aussie HiFire has written an excellent post about [*sequencing risk*](https://aussiehifire.com/2018/10/26/sequencing-risk-on-the-road-to-fire-returns-arent-smooth-and-why-it-matters/) - the difference between your projections of net worth, and amount that you actually turn out to have, *n* years down the road, due to the non-linear nature of asset returns. Indeed, at the time of this writing, the highest Australian risk-free rate (on a HISA) is about 2.25% to 2%, and `VTS` hasn't really gone up (or down) in half a year. The most you can count on in such a scenario is brute force - increase in net worth just by stacking paper. Increasing margins of safety to psychologically comfortable amounts is probably the strongest rationale behind *one more year* (OMY), even after hitting FI. 

Would you, then, really want to retire during a bull market, even a weak bull market? Hell no. Most FIRE adherents will probably be too strongly driven to make hay while the sun shines. Therefore, due to this psychological opportunity cost, it's actually optimal to retire during a bear market. As an unfortunate corollary, this might mean that your choice to retire would not be *entirely* on your terms. 

But that's fine. One day, probably a couple years after FI, you'll stroll into work as usual, then get a call into your boss's office. Preferably, the reason for your dismissal would be purely economical (as opposed to your being a lazy bastard) - you're a good worker, but they just can't make the personnel numbers this year due to the gloomy economic outlook. But, at this point, you'd already have a serious stash built up that you won't even care any more. At most, you'll be slightly disappointed that you're not able to snap up even more assets at bargain prices, as tends to happen during economic downturns. 

And just like that, you've FIRE'd. If you've been doing it well enough, from early enough, enjoy the rest of your 40 to 50 years on this earth in perpetual comfort.
