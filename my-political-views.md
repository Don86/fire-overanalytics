# My Political Views (and why they matter)

The TLDR: I couldn't trust anyone in Canberra to run a 7-11, much less plan a sustainable welfare pension system. A general jovial mistrust of politicians is quite the trendy view to have. 

I *also* know a lot of people who agree with me on that, but, when asked about how they plan to retire, rather just shrug it off, saying: "the government/system/Centrelink will take care of me". Obviously, these two perspectives should not be able to co-exist. 

As such, *mistrust of politicians* creates the need for an additional safety margin.
