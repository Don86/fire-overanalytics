# The Psychology of Buying vs. Renting

Here, I'm only covering the psychology of buying versus renting, because the actual calculations vary too widely between cities, even within the same country. Some calculators may be due in future.

Note: I have a considerable bias toward renting.

TLDR:
 * It seems more a personal decision than a financial one. IMO, buying is not for minimalists.
 * Buying is riskier, but generally yields more returns. It's not a great marginal return over the enormous increase in risk, though. 
 * Buying is cheaper, in the *very* long run.
 * Renting is cheaper, and better, for almost any capital city that you might care to name, over any length of time. I believe that this remains true even if you rent afor life (no hard numbers, though). 
 * Personal strategy: be a disciplined renter who rents cheap and invests the difference, then buy a much cheaper and smaller place away from capital cities for retirement, almost entirely in cash. This works for me because I have little attachment to large cities anyway. 

## Buying

### Pros

* I've seen some long-term studies where real estate gives slightly higher returns than equity, though I never did dig deep enough to see if these studies accounted for cost of ownership. `Citation needed`.
* You're forced to save. I know any number of renters who agree with me that renting beats buying (over maybe 30 years or so) if you invest the difference, but I wonder how many people *actually remember to invest the difference*. 
* Unlike investing, you can't monitor the value of your house every day, so you won't really witness small decreases in value. 
* Buying financially works out better the longer you stay, i.e. on a scale of 50 years or so. 

### Cons

* *You tend to buy more house than you need*. Not all residential property types and locations appreciate at the same rate. In order to make buying work out financially, you tend to have to shoot for more expensive property than what a single person/a couple generally needs. 
* "Kids need stability". No they don't. They need loving parents. 
* You can't take advantage of economic downturns for fire sales (unless you have a few hundred thousand grand just sitting around somewhere). 
* Absolutely no diversification. This is psychological as much as economic: you'll need to do a stupid amount of homework to make an intelligent purchase, and luck can still screw you over (or serve you well). You need to be right about almost everything for this one large purchase.
* Your first residence serves a dual purpose: for your personal use, and investment. Where you want to live and where you want to invest in are not always the same area; the only way to sidestep this is to have multiple properties (For that matter, whether you want to invest for capital gains or rental yields are not always even the same).
* The more leveraged you are, the more vulnerable you are. Some people don't mind this: perhaps they have good work places, good bosses, good salaries - none of which you can count on to last forever (restructuring can happen even in good times when some new management wants to meddle to appear useful, good bosses get promoted away or move on, salaries may not always keep up...). In short, I imagine that the stars have to align **too perfectly** for me to be personally comfortable with that amount of debt.
