# The Psychology of Buying vs. Renting

Here, I'm only covering the psychology of buying versus renting, because the actual calculations vary too widely between cities, even within the same country. Some calculators may be due in future.

Note: I have a considerable bias toward renting.

## Buying

* Overall, a riskier enterprise, so it's actually reasonable that real-estate returns should be higher. But, I'm surprised that given the enormous amount of personal and economic risk that you're taking on, real-estate returns at most 2 percentage points more than stock over decades (and that's a serious over-estimate). 
* This is because, if you're a faithful index investor who's in this for the long game, you're *never* forced to sell off. Even if your portfolio value drops by 90%, you won't realize those losses unless you lose your nerve and sell. However, any sufficiently large (and admittedly rare...but not as rare as one might think) economic downturn can trigger mortgage stress and defaults, and eventually foreclosure. 

### Pros

* I've seen some long-term studies where real estate gives slightly higher returns than equity, though I never did dig deep enough to see if these studies accounted for cost of ownership. `Citation needed`.
* You're forced to save. I know any number of renters who agree with me that renting beats buying (over maybe 30 years or so) if you invest the difference, but I wonder how many people *actually remember to invest the difference*. 
* Unlike investing, you can't monitor the value of your house every day, so you won't really witness small decreases in value. 
* I honestly can't think of anything else.

### Cons

* You can't take advantage of economic downturns for fire sales (unless you have a few hundred thousand grand just sitting around somewhere). 
* Absolutely no diversification. This is psychological as much as economic: you'll need to do a stupid amount of homework to make an intelligent purchase, and luck can still screw you over (or serve you well). You need to be right about almost everything for this one large purchase.
* Your first residence serves a dual purpose: for your personal use, and investment. Where you want to live and where you want to invest in are not always the same area; the only way to sidestep this is to have multiple properties (For that matter, whether you want to invest for capital gains or rental yields are not always even the same).
* The more leveraged you are, the more vulnerable you are. Some people don't mind this: perhaps they have good work places, good bosses, good salaries - none of which you can count on to last forever (restructuring can happen even in good times when some new management wants to meddle to appear useful, good bosses get promoted away or move on, salaries may not always keep up...). In short, I imagine that the stars have to align **too perfectly** for me to be personally comfortable with that amount of debt.
