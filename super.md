# Super

* You can currently only access your Super after 60. There are exceptional sitautions, but these are extremely rare and punitive (tax-wise). Most FIRE bloggers assume that the preservation age will be raised to 65 in a few decades.
* The tax-savings from pre-tax contributions (i.e. salary sacrificing into Super), especially for the higher income earners with tax brackets, are just too good to pass up. 
* Super is, in general, a less efficient investment vehicle (*much* higher fees, inefficient asset allocations, fewer options, etc.). But even the fastest growing, most risk-efficient ETF bought outside of super will be subject to income tax anyway (even factoring in the 50% CGT discount). 
* Super withdrawals from a taxed super fund are [tax-free](https://www.moneysmart.gov.au/superannuation-and-retirement/how-super-works/tax-and-super). No capital gains tax. 
* Average life expectancy in Australia is 82.5 years. 
* I'd throw some money in there, call it $500k by 65. 
* The one con that turns off most FIRE adherents: you can't retire early. Personally, I'm more about the FI than the RE; I simply wouldn't know what to do with myself if I retired early.
