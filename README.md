# FIRE-overanalytics

FIRE == Financial Independence, Retire Early

## Intro

This repo will be a list of notes and long-form thoughts I have on the possible portfolio paths to fire. 

* I'm based in Australia. If there's anyone outside Australia, I'll try my best to make things generalizable, but YMMV/DYOR. 
* I don't actually care much about the RE; just the FI. Beyond FI, I'll work for fun, on my own terms. 
* I've identified different levels to fire. These are:
  1. **GhettoFIRE**: I can retire, with housemates, in the cheapest area I can find, but that's about it. I'd be strictly reliant on free forms of entertainment. 
  2. **ComfyFIRE**: I can retire in my own place, *or* I can rent with housemates, and have more wiggle room when it comes to entertainment. 
  3. **TravelFIRE**: level 2, plus I have about $5k per year to go travelling. 
  4. **FatFIRE**: Anything beyond. 
  
There's a reason why this repo is called *"over-analytics"*; most of this is, admittedly, just an excuse for me to play with programming tools, methods, and analysis. The stock market, or any growth asset which you choose to invest in, is just too highly variable for anyone to be able to make any kind of meaningful prediction without having massive confidence intervals ayway. There's a quote by Paul Krugman: *"All the statistical sophistication in the world could not allow me to predict your phone number."*. All that really matters is:

```
Spend less than you earn – invest the surplus – avoid debt

Do simply this and you’ll wind up rich.  Not just in money.

- JL Collins
```

Lastly: the purpose of all this documentation is for self-reflection, and see how my opinions might change over time. This is especially useful to monitor my own efficacy in decision making. Most prominently, I'm too young for any of this to be taken as truth - the financial systems in place haven't matured, and I personally do not have enough life experience. If any interested party happens upon this repo, do *not* believe me outright (even I don't believe myself outright). Find opposing viewpoints, make your own judgements, and repurpose the useful parts to suit your current life situation. 

Overall, though, if you just follow the JL Collins quote, you'll be all right.

## References

* **JL Collins** - I think that this guy's the master of them all, because he's lived it all. 
* **Aussie HiFire** - Casts a very critical and analytical eye on the maths and data behind retirement, but (like me), may be subject to prediction outcomes that actually have too large confidence intervals to put much trust in. Whoever this is, they have a more cautious personality, which makes for an valuable counterpart to MMM. 
* **Aussie firebug** - Just started reading, no opinions yet. 
* **MMM** - I like his blog for the optimistic bent, and environmental angle as well. His critics, even in the FI community, accuse him of being too naive, or unsuitable for low- or even median-income earners. 
* **Strong Money Australia** - Just started reading, no opinions yet.
