# FIRE-overanalytics

FIRE == Financial Independence, Retire Early

## Intro

This repo will be a list of notes and long-form thoughts I have on the possible portfolio paths to fire. Some notes:

* I'm based in Australia. If there's anyone outside Australia, I'll try my best to make things generalizable, but YMMV/DYOR. 
* I don't actually care much about the RE; just the FI. 
* I've identified different levels to fire. These are:
  1. **GhettoFIRE**: I can survive indefinitely, with housemates, in the cheapest area I can find, but that's about it. I'd be reliant strictly on free forms of entertainment. 
  2. **ComfyFIRE**: I can survive indefinitely in my own place, *or* I can rent with housemates, and have more wiggle room when it comes to entertainment. 
  3. **TravelFIRE**: level 2, plus I have about $5k per year to go travelling. 
  4. **FatFIRE**: Anything beyond. 
  
There's a reason why this repo is called *"over-analytics"*; most of this is, admittedly, just an excuse for me to play with programming tools, methods, and analysis. The randomness and variability inherent in real data is just too huge to be able to pin down any predicted returns with sufficiently slim confidence intervals. All that really matters is:

```
Spend less than you earn – invest the surplus – avoid debt

Do simply this and you’ll wind up rich.  Not just in money.
