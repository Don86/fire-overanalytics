# We Can't All Be Financially Independent

Mr Money Mustache [has written about this before](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/04/09/what-if-everyone-became-frugal/): what if everyone became super frugal? The TLDR of his post is: 

>So, frugality as a whole would work very well for society. We’d produce less, and we’d earn less, but that is perfect since we would consume less as well.

Which is kind of great, really, especially from an ecological perspective. But, thinking about all this, and my own mental model of the economy, my opinion is that *FI for the few of us requires a lot of people buying a whole lot of junk they don't need*. 

### Why?

My own mental model of the economy is much like metabolism (the set of life-sustaining biochemical reactions) in the human body (doesn't need to be human; any organism would do). Cells need nutrients and energy to do stuff, but raw nutrients/energy/water/whatever from the outside world need to be processed into a chemical/molecular form that can be used by the cells themselves. For instance, the "currency" of the human body is *adenosine triphosphate* (ATP), which is an energy molecule that's fairly universally consumed by many cells to do their thing. 

There are fairly well-defined biological processes that manufacture these nutrients. [Glycolysis and the citric acid cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate#Glycolysis), for instance, produces ATP-equivalents (and some other stuff that also gets used). There are many other such secondary processes that produce other forms of nutrients, The point is: these are the "industries" of the human body, which produce stuff for cells to use (ignore for the moment the fact that ATP is just produced and then distributed to the rest of the body; cells don't have to give anything in return). There are also processes for converting excess nutrients into a form that can be put away for later use, i.e. producing fat stores. 

In a perfectly fit and healthy human body (owned by an extremely disciplined person), input matches output very closely. The cells use only what they need; some excess is put away for purposes of redundancy, but not too much, and certainly not so much that it starts to interfere with the overall performance of the system. This is a frugal economy.

(A quirk of evolution/psychology that further improves the quality of this metaphor: there are very few physiological or psyhochological barriers to get you to *stop eating*, no matter how much stores of fat you have, simply because the human body evolved within environments where food has always been scarce. Evolution was not prepared for the abundance of food we have in many developed nations.)

Now, imagine that our frugal person really starts to enjoy eating. So intake starts to increase drastically. This is llike the economy that demands 

Note that I like this mental model more because it further sharpens with context. For instance, I don't really *care* if the economy grows; it has to grow at a rate that is suitable for the purposes of the system. Too much, and the economy gets fat.
