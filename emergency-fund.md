# The Emergency Fund

TLDR: Two kinds of emergency fund: pre- and post-*retirement* (not FI). 
* The pre-retirement emergency fund is ~3-6 months of living expenses, no more than 1 year.
* The post-retirement emergency fund is ~3 years of living expenses, no more than 4 years. 

### Sizes of emergency fund(s)

**Pre-retirement**, assuming you have an income, you'll need your emergency fund to smooth out unexpectedly large consumption, e.g. medical bills. 

**Post-retirement**, you'll need your emergency fund as a store of rations to weather a possible recession. To put things in perspective, this is how long it took for the S&P500 to recover after the 2008 GFC:

That's 5.5 years. During this period, be prepared to be unable to "just get a side-hustle", or have dividends reduced to half or less than their usual amounts. The second use of your post-retirement emergency fund is to fund some truly unusually large medical bills; the last few decades of life will cost more than all the healthy years in between. 

I've thought that the best way to build up that emergency fund is to:
1. Buy a large amount of a high-growth ETF, such as VTS, as early on as possible. 
2. Upon retirement, at least a decade later, liquidate this ETF and stash it away in a HISA, where it should be at a risk-free interest rate that should just barely keep pace with inflation. 

Of course, there are other less conservative ways about this: you could have two layers of post-R emergency fund: a certain amount in cash, another in a less liquid, but still growing, ETF. Balance between having to utilize the cash amount and intelligently liquidating the allocated-emergency ETF as required.
