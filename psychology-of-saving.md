# The Psychology of Spending

I once had a colleague at work make light fun of me having instant coffee (don't diss the Blend 43), saying: "You have a full time job now; don't they pay you for your labour?"

Obviously he was just having some light fun, but the real answer is:

* Yes, you could, in fact, be disciplined enough to enjoy life's small expenditures, if you do manage to rein in the major ones. 
* This requires some considerable mental accounting skills ("is this an acceptably small expense? Have I reached my personal allowance for the month?")
* It's just easier to *say no to everything by default*.
